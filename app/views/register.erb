  <p>Welcome, adventurer. You've successfully made it this far, but your journey has only just begun. To complete the next step, you'll need to create a form on this page that will direct the visitor to enter an email address and a password, and then click a button that will attempt to register them.</p>
  <p> Once the form is in place, make sure it can post to a route in your RegistrationsController, and then go there for more instruction.</p>
  <p> Remember to delete these instructions when complete so that the next visitor only sees the results of your hard work.</p>
